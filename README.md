# AVARUUS

AVARUUS is an old school local multiplayer space shooter game.
Defeat your opponents with various weapons, tools and other
items and survive as the last man standing to win.
Get ready for a blast from the past!

HOW TO PLAY
----------------------------------------------------------------

The game features a local multiplayer for 2 to 3 players.
Players fight against each other in an open space arena using
weapons, tools and other items on their way to victory.

The space arena is deviously warped enabling the players and
bullets to travel from one side to another. You may ambush your
enemies with clever diversion or strike them head on - the
choice is yours!

The last man standing will win the round. The player with most
round victories will win the match and claim the fame on the
top list.

CONTROLS
----------------------------------------------------------------

The game can be played with the keyboard or a gamepad. Player
controls can be configured in the settings menu.

The game supports Xbox 360 controllers only. Consider using a
controller emulator for non-supported gamepads.

DEVELOPMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------

The very first prototype version of the game ("H.I.P.P.4.") was
released in 2006. Other major development sprints occurred in
2008 and in 2011 but the game was never finalized until 2018.

The 2006 version of the game participated in a Finnish game
creation competition by CBCorner.net, placing 5th. The sequel
released in 2008 took part in another game creation competition
held by Pelisivut.org, placing 4th. The 2011 version was an
overhaul of the original concept, and was initially unreleased.

After nearly a decade of inactivity in the development the game
was almost lost forever - but luckily it was recovered and could
be released with some newly added features and fixes.

The game was created with a legacy game engine called CoolBasic.
The engine was already outdated technology-wise when the
development of the game began.

The game was originally created for DirectX 7.0 (DirectDraw).
Consider running the game in compatibility mode or using a
third-party wrapper to enhance the game performance if needed.
