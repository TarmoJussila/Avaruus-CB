# AVARUUS

AVARUUS is an old school local multiplayer space shooter game.
Defeat your opponents with various weapons, tools and other
items and survive as the last man standing to win.
Get ready for a blast from the past!

HOW TO PLAY
----------------------------------------------------------------

The game features a local multiplayer for 2 to 3 players.
Players fight against each other in an open space arena using
weapons, tools and other items on their way to victory.

The space arena is deviously warped enabling the players and
bullets to travel from one side to another. You may ambush your
enemies with clever diversion or strike them head on - the
choice is yours!

The last man standing will win the round. The player with most
round victories will win the match and claim the fame on the
top list.

CONTROLS
----------------------------------------------------------------

The game can be played with the keyboard or a gamepad. Player
controls can be configured in the settings menu.

The game supports Xbox 360 controllers only. Consider using a
controller emulator for non-supported gamepads.

DEVELOPMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------

The very first prototype version of the game was released in
2006. Other major development sprints occurred in 2008 and in
2011 but the game was never finalized until 2018.

After nearly a decade of inactivity in the development the game
was almost lost forever - but luckily it was recovered and could
be released with some newly added features and fixes.

The game was developed with experimental CoolBasic game engine
which was already outdated technology-wise when the development
of AVARUUS began.
